# Bo Zhang's Portfolio
My Data Analytics/Machine Learning Projects
## [Analyzing risk and returns of investment in stock market](https://github.com/TheophilusZhang/Sharp_ratio_Datacamp/blob/main/sharp_ratio.ipynb)
* Visualize and summarize data of daily stock prices of AMZN and FB vs. SPY in 2016 with **Python**. 
* Used pandas to calculate and compare profitability and risk of different investments using the Sharpe Ratio and identified stocks to increase ROI by 2 folds

## [Predicting credit card approvals by machine learning](https://github.com/TheophilusZhang/datacamp_ML_credit_card/blob/main/ML_credit_card_approval.ipynb)
* Preprocessed data such as scaling, label encoding, and missing value imputation with **Python** 
* Predicted if an application for a credit card will be accepted by logistic regression on 690 applicants with 15 features
*	Used grid search to find the best performing model and achieve more than 95% accuracy
## [Optimizing online sports retail revenue](https://github.com/TheophilusZhang/SQL_online_revenue_Datacamp/blob/main/ecommerce_SQL.ipynb)
*	Cleaned data of sales data of 3179 products of an online sports retail database with **SQL**
*	Joined tables and aggregated them by brand and category, then identified an average 30% off discount raises sales by $1,724,335.82 in total revenue
*	Analyzed correlation between customer reviews and revenue, product descriptions and seasonal effects.
## [Analyzing bike-share business user trends](https://github.com/TheophilusZhang/R_cyclistic_user_analysis/blob/main/google-analytics-capstone-project-cyclistic.ipynb)
*	Clean, wrangle and visualize data with **R** to identify usage trends between users of a bike-share business. 
*	Write summary reports for stakeholders to improve the business problem
# Other raw codes(Not Jupyter Notebook)
### [Detecting cardiological disorder by machine learning](https://github.com/TheophilusZhang/Heart_disease/blob/main/Heartbeat.py)
* Classifying heartbeat anomalies from stethoscope audio data with **Python**
*	Smooth raw audio data and visualize the audio signal to create new "features" from raw data and score prediction accuracy with cross-validation
### [Childhood autistic spectrum disorder screening by machine learning](https://github.com/TheophilusZhang/Autism/blob/main/Autism.py)
* Build and deploy a neural network using the Keras to diagnose Autism based on behavioral features and individual characteristics of 292 patients
